    <h2>About this project</h2>
    <p>I built this simple tool for aiding researchers and students in "quick and dirty" experimentation of domino tilings on the square lattice. My hope is that you'll be able to use it to come up with and check new conjectures about domino tilings. </p>
    <p>
      Tiling Calculator is not intended to be used for larger or more systematic calculations. Unfortunately, numbers larger than 2<sup>53</sup> cannot be factored, and counting the number of tilings of large regions becomes prohibitively slow. To that end, I recommend checking out <a href="http://faculty.uml.edu/jpropp/vaxmaple.c">vaxmaple</a>, a C program developed by Greg Kuperberg, Jim Propp, and David Wilson that can be used together with Maple for calculating tilings of regions specified in VAX format.

      This number of tilings is computed using the Kasteleyn-Percus method. You can find the code for this website on GitHub at <a style="white-space: nowrap" href="https://github.com/forest-tong/tiling-calculator">https://github.com/forest-tong/tiling-calculator</a>.

    <h2>About me</h2>
<!--     <p><a href="/Users/ftong/Desktop/Website/index.html">My personal website</a></p> -->
    <p>I am a student at MIT studying mathematics and computer science. My introduction to the weird and wonderful field of domino tilings came through a research project in 2013 under the mentorship of Henry Cohn, in which I studied divisibility of domino tilings for a class of graphs I defined "compound graphs." Check out my paper, <a style="white-space: nowrap" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0669.pdf"><i>On the number of perfect matchings of compound graphs</i></a>, on the arXiv. </p>
    <p>Feel free to contact me with questions or feedback at ftong[at]mit.edu.</p>

    <h2>Bugs</h2>
    <p>
      Copying the number of tilings doesn't work in IE. It should work in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
